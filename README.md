2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[YOUR ANSWER HERE]
A challenge that I encountered in creating the submission for the project is trying to figure out how to use Github for the first time. As a beginner Github user, I found the site to be quite confusing at first before it was helpful. I struggled with uploading my glitch project to my repository, and figuring out what I did incorrectly was time consuming. Even when it seemed I successfully uploaded and pushed all required files onto my prework repository, my work was still not showing up like it was supposed to. I was able to overcome this by carefully rewatching the videos provided by Codepath as a guide for repository set-up and file publishing, and I also looked up an additional resource for help.
Additionally, I struggled with converting a 30 second video displaying all of the features/code on my project into a GIF that would fit in all parts of my video. At first, I struggled to find a website that would convert my video for free, as most sites would ask for a membership. I was able to figure it out by also rewatching the videos provided by Codepath, as well as searching Google for any sites that would let me convert a 30 second video to a GIF. I also included two GIF links in my submission in case one GIF link errors. 
3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[YOUR ANSWER HERE]
After completing my submission, I am very interested in how HTML, CSS and Javascript can work together to make an interactive webpage. A question I have is how much of web site creation/development can already be found online, and what tools/techniques can be used to make a website unique from others? Additionally, how much more difficult is it to build a webpage without using helper sites like glitch, and is web development from scratch still common? I also noticed that this submission included Object Oriented Programming and was curious of any tips for keeping track of the many variables and attributes across different langauges and workspace tabs, especially if one is working on a large project.
4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[YOUR ANSWER HERE]
If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would like to add more random variation in the pattern played for the user to play back. This way, every game would start and end in a unique way and would make for a more entertaining experience rather than repeating the same sequence of tones every game run. Additionally, I would like to implement game levels by adding more tones and buttons as the game progresses, and increasing complexity and speed of tone patterns as players level up. Lastly, I would also like to add more game options (derived from the original Light and Memory Game), instead of just the Light and Memory Game being the only game option to play.
